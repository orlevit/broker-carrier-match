Update the code with carrier appetite guide metadata as a structured JSON with these scheme:
{
'carrier_name':...,
'section':  (explanation: this should be a list of the parent number, the parent numbers should be created as dictionary and the number represent the section),
'geographical_region' : {'include':[...], 'exclude':[...]}]},
'coverage': [{...}],
'capacity': [{...}],
'limit': [{...}],
'Natural_disaster' : {'include':[...], 'exclude':[...]}]},
}
Note: 
capacity is the maximum risk an insurer can underwrite, coverage refers to the specific risks or damages the policy protects against, and limit is the maximum amount the insurer will pay for a specific claim.

# Property Insurance Appetite Guide

## Overview
Target Total Insured Value (TIV): Under $250 million

## Target Classes

### Manufacturing and Industrial

* Recyclers
* Woodworkers (minimum premium threshold of $100,000)
* Metal working/forging operations (excluding foundry/casting)

### Real Estate
* Vacant properties (excluding unsprinklered wood frame)
* Habitational high-rises
* Select low-rise buildings (non-frame construction)

### Special Risk Areas
* Wildfire exposed risks in:
  * California
  * Colorado
  * New Mexico
  * Nevada
  * Arizona
* Monoline Flood (excluding Tier 1 locations)
  * Will consider: Midtown Manhattan and other NYC boroughs
  * Will not consider: Jones Beach, Jersey Shore, Red Hook

## Conditional Classes
The following will be considered on a case-by-case basis:
* Food and Agriculture operations
* Other classes not specifically excluded below

## Excluded Classes

### Geographic/Peril Restrictions
* Wind/Flood exposure in Tier 1 counties south of Virginia
* California and Pacific Northwest Earthquake exposure

### Construction/Occupancy
* Glass manufacturing
* Foam manufacturing
* Grain silos
* Foundries and casting operations
* Unsprinklered frame habitational
* Frame habitational in Texas/Oklahoma

## Key Underwriting Considerations

* Heightened scrutiny for wildfire exposure
* Frame habitational is generally not targeted
  * Starting rate of 0.40 on frame habitational for primary $5mm
* Tier 1 wind exposure is declined
