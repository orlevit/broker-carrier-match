You are expert data engineer and data scientist.
Your task is to build a vectordb for appetite guides.
Task Requirements
Core Functionality
Document Processing
Ingest and process the provided carrier appetite guides
Implement an effective chunking strategy
Store embeddings in a vector database 
The data is one file name: 'guide.json', which have data like:
[{
    "carrier_name": "Moxie",
    "guide": "# Moxie Habitational Insurance Appetite Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nMoxie offers comprehensive Habitational Insurance coverage for apartment buildings.\n\n## Availability\n\n- Available in AZ, CA, NV, OR, and WA for Apartments\n\n## Capacity\n\n- Up to $15 million Total Insured Value (TIV) for any one location\n- 2/4 General Liability Limits\n  - Subject to approval on larger accounts over $10,000 in premium\n\n## Eligibility Criteria\n\n- Minimum Premium starting at $2,500\n- No age restriction on buildings\n- Buildings must not be on historical registry\n\n## Target Classes\n\n- Apartment buildings\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\n1.

  }, ...]
Create the block in the vectordb in the foloowing way:
Since the carrier appetite, has herarcical strucate, embed every bullet point with the addition previous headers. In addition embed each section. 
For example, the following text:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader1
* subHeader1 text1
## subHeader2
* subHeader2 text1
* subHeader2 text2

should be embedded in the following ways:
section1:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader1
* subHeader1 text1
## subHeader2
* subHeader2 text1
* subHeader2 text2

section2:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader1
* subHeader1 text1

section3:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader2
* subHeader2 text1
* subHeader2 text2

section4:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader2
* subHeader2 text1

section5:
# Header1
header text1
## subHeader2
* subHeader2 text2
